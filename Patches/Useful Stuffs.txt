How to Add apps:
- Port ROM (Assume if the system is EROFS)
- Turn on SELinux Context Patch in MIO-Kitchen Setting
- Make a new folder in /product/priv-app/[App Name]
- Put the .apk inside the new app folder

- GSI (Assume if the system is EXT)
- Disclaimer: This method is more like replacing app, since there's no way to do add a new app
without turning on SELinux Context Patch
- Search for a similiar app folder (Ex: Twelve (LOS Music App))
- Rename & Replace the Twelve.apk to Accord.apk (Make sure the name is still same)
- Delete all oat, or data or anything else. The only thing remains is only the .apk file

Note: Not all APK can be added
